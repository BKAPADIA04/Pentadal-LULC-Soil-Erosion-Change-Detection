Error matrix:
List (4 elements)
0: [755, 64, 7, 0]
1: [160, 1795, 55, 6]
2: [20, 134, 938, 0]
3: [1, 19, 3, 594]


The error matrix (also known as a confusion matrix) is a table that represents the performance of a classification model by comparing predicted class labels with actual class labels. Here's a breakdown of your matrix:

Error matrix:

0: [755, 64, 7, 0]
1: [160, 1795, 55, 6]
2: [20, 134, 938, 0]
3: [1, 19, 3, 594]
```

### **Structure of the Matrix**
Each row represents the actual class, and each column represents the predicted class. For a 4-class classification problem, the matrix dimensions are \(4 \times 4\). The diagonal values are the correctly classified instances for each class, while off-diagonal values represent misclassifications.

#### **Legend for Rows and Columns**
Assume your class labels are:
- **0**: Urban Area  
- **1**: Agriculture Area  
- **2**: Deforested Area  
- **3**: Riverbank Area  

The rows (0, 1, 2, 3) correspond to the true labels, and the columns (0, 1, 2, 3) correspond to the predicted labels.

### **Interpretation**
- **Row 0** (True class: Urban Area):
  - **755** instances correctly classified as Urban Area (true positives).
  - **64** misclassified as Agriculture Area.
  - **7** misclassified as Deforested Area.
  - **0** misclassified as Riverbank Area.

- **Row 1** (True class: Agriculture Area):
  - **160** misclassified as Urban Area.
  - **1795** correctly classified as Agriculture Area (true positives).
  - **55** misclassified as Deforested Area.
  - **6** misclassified as Riverbank Area.

- **Row 2** (True class: Deforested Area):
  - **20** misclassified as Urban Area.
  - **134** misclassified as Agriculture Area.
  - **938** correctly classified as Deforested Area (true positives).
  - **0** misclassified as Riverbank Area.

- **Row 3** (True class: Riverbank Area):
  - **1** misclassified as Urban Area.
  - **19** misclassified as Agriculture Area.
  - **3** misclassified as Deforested Area.
  - **594** correctly classified as Riverbank Area (true positives).

### **Key Metrics**

1. **Accuracy for Each Class**:
   - Class 0 (Urban Area): \( \frac{755}{755 + 64 + 7 + 0} = 91.07\% \)
   - Class 1 (Agriculture Area): \( \frac{1795}{160 + 1795 + 55 + 6} = 88.64\% \)
   - Class 2 (Deforested Area): \( \frac{938}{20 + 134 + 938 + 0} = 86.73\% \)
   - Class 3 (Riverbank Area): \( \frac{594}{1 + 19 + 3 + 594} = 96.25\% \)

2. **Overall Accuracy**:
   This can be calculated by dividing the total number of correct classifications by the total number of instances:
   \[
   \text{Overall Accuracy} = \frac{\text{Sum of Diagonal Elements}}{\text{Total Instances}} 
   \]
   \[
   = \frac{755 + 1795 + 938 + 594}{\text{Sum of all matrix elements}}
   \]

3. **Error Rate**:
   \[
   \text{Error Rate} = 1 - \text{Overall Accuracy}
   \]

4. **Misclassification Patterns**:
   - Most errors for class **0** (Urban Area) are confused with **1** (Agriculture Area).
   - Class **1** (Agriculture Area) is occasionally confused with **0** and **2**.
   - Class **2** (Deforested Area) has significant confusion with **1**.
   - Class **3** (Riverbank Area) has the least misclassification.
