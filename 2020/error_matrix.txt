### **Structure of the Matrix**
As before, each row represents the actual class, and each column represents the predicted class. The diagonal values (in bold) represent the correct classifications, and the off-diagonal values represent misclassifications.

### **Interpretation of Rows**

#### **Row 0** (True class: Urban Area):
- **779** instances correctly classified as Urban Area (**true positives**).
- **74** misclassified as Agriculture Area.
- **14** misclassified as Deforested Area.
- **0** misclassified as Riverbank Area.

#### **Row 1** (True class: Agriculture Area):
- **138** misclassified as Urban Area.
- **1730** correctly classified as Agriculture Area (**true positives**).
- **43** misclassified as Deforested Area.
- **1** misclassified as Riverbank Area.

#### **Row 2** (True class: Deforested Area):
- **28** misclassified as Urban Area.
- **124** misclassified as Agriculture Area.
- **928** correctly classified as Deforested Area (**true positives**).
- **0** misclassified as Riverbank Area.

#### **Row 3** (True class: Riverbank Area):
- **1** misclassified as Urban Area.
- **23** misclassified as Agriculture Area.
- **2** misclassified as Deforested Area.
- **584** correctly classified as Riverbank Area (**true positives**).

### **Key Metrics**

#### 1. **Per-Class Accuracy**
The accuracy for each class is calculated as:
\[
\text{Class Accuracy} = \frac{\text{Correctly Classified Instances}}{\text{Total Instances for the Class}}
\]

- **Class 0 (Urban Area)**:
  \[
  \text{Accuracy} = \frac{779}{779 + 74 + 14 + 0} = \frac{779}{867} = 89.85\%
  \]
- **Class 1 (Agriculture Area)**:
  \[
  \text{Accuracy} = \frac{1730}{138 + 1730 + 43 + 1} = \frac{1730}{1912} = 90.45\%
  \]
- **Class 2 (Deforested Area)**:
  \[
  \text{Accuracy} = \frac{928}{28 + 124 + 928 + 0} = \frac{928}{1080} = 85.93\%
  \]
- **Class 3 (Riverbank Area)**:
  \[
  \text{Accuracy} = \frac{584}{1 + 23 + 2 + 584} = \frac{584}{610} = 95.74\%
  \]

#### 2. **Overall Accuracy**
The overall accuracy is calculated as:
\[
\text{Overall Accuracy} = \frac{\text{Sum of Diagonal Elements}}{\text{Total Number of Instances}}
\]
\[
\text{Overall Accuracy} = \frac{779 + 1730 + 928 + 584}{867 + 1912 + 1080 + 610} = \frac{4021}{4469} = 89.99\%
\]

#### 3. **Error Rate**
\[
\text{Error Rate} = 1 - \text{Overall Accuracy} = 1 - 0.8999 = 10.01\%
\]

#### 4. **Misclassification Patterns**
- **Class 0 (Urban Area)**: Most errors are confused with **Class 1 (Agriculture Area)** (74 instances).
- **Class 1 (Agriculture Area)**: Most errors are confused with **Class 0 (Urban Area)** (138 instances) and **Class 2 (Deforested Area)** (43 instances).
- **Class 2 (Deforested Area)**: Errors are spread between **Class 1 (Agriculture Area)** (124 instances) and **Class 0 (Urban Area)** (28 instances).
- **Class 3 (Riverbank Area)**: Minimal confusion, with **23 instances misclassified as Class 1 (Agriculture Area)**.

### **Comparison to the Previous Matrix**
- Overall accuracy has slightly decreased (previously ~90.27%, now 89.99%).
- Per-class accuracy for **Class 2 (Deforested Area)** has declined slightly, from 86.73% to 85.93%.
- **Class 3 (Riverbank Area)** maintains a high accuracy with minimal misclassification.
